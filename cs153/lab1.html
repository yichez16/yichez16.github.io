<h1>Lab 1: Fun with system calls</h1>
<p>
<b>Handed out Friday June 28, 2024<br />
Due Thursday July 18, 2024</b>

</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In this assignment, you will design a new system call for xv6, and use
it in some fork synchronization problems.  The goals of this assignment are:
<ul>
<li>Understand the system call interface
<li>Understand how user programs send parameters to the kernel, and receive values back 
<li>See how the event handling in the Operating System works
<li>Understand the process structure and modify it
</ul>

The deliverables for the assignment are the code that includes the
required changes (the new system call, and modifications to exit), as
well as the user test program(s).  You will be graded at least
partially by interview and expected to demonstrate that you understand
what you did and why you did it that way for the full project
(including the part done by other partner).

<h2>Getting started</h2>

Follow the <a href="./labs.html">instructions on the class lab page</a> to set up xv6 either on sledge or on your own machine using the vagrant option.  

After installation or if you are working on slege, to get started:


<p>Open two terminal windows.  In one, enter <kbd>make
qemu-gdb</kbd> (or <kbd>make qemu-nox-gdb</kbd>).  This starts up
QEMU, but QEMU stops just before the
processor executes the first instruction and waits for a debugging
connection from GDB.  In the second terminal, from the same directory
you ran <tt>make</tt>, run <kbd>gdb</kbd>.  (Briefly, <tt>gdb -q -iex "set auto-load safe-path /home/csprofs/nael/xv6-master/"
</tt>.  Change the last part to your path to the xv6 directory.   You should see something
like this,</p>

<pre>
sledge% <kbd>gdb</kbd>

The target architecture is assumed to be i8086
[f000:fff0] 0xffff0:ljmp   $0xf000,$0xe05b
0x0000fff0 in ?? ()
+ symbol-file obj/kern/kernel
(gdb) 
</pre>

<p> Now set a breakpoint on exec() by typing 

<tt>break exec</tt> in the gdb window

type <tt>continue</tt> 

You should see something like:
<pre>
(gdb) cont
Continuing.
[New Thread 2]
[Switching to Thread 2]
The target architecture is assumed to be i386
=> 0x80100af8 <exec>:push   %ebp

Breakpoint 1, exec (path=0x1c "/init", argv=0x8dfffe98) at exec.c:12
12{
(gdb)
</pre>

<p>
Here we stop execution after the OS is initialized at the stage where
it is starting the first process (init).  If you type continue again,
you will break again as follows:

<pre>
gdb) cont
Continuing.
[Switching to Thread 1]
=> 0x80100af8 <exec>:push   %ebp

Breakpoint 1, exec (path=0x8c3 "sh", argv=0x8dffee98) at exec.c:12
12{
</pre>

<p>
As you can see, at this stage, init started a shell process which is
the xv6 shell we get when the OS boots.  If you continue again, gdb
will not return since it is waiting for a command to be started in the
shell.  Switch to the other window and try typing a command (for
example, <tt>cat README</tt>) at which time you will get another break
as the shell forks then execs the cat program.

Feel free to look around at the program when it breaks to see how we
reach the system call which should give you ideas about how to add
one.  


<h3>Assignment</h3>

<p>Part 1 (25 points): Add a new system call getsiblings().  This system call takes no
arguments, and prints the id of any sibling processes of the calling process.
Sibling processes are those that share the same parent.

<p>Part 2 (20 points): Extend the current xv6 process implementation
to maintain an exit status.  To get this done, add a field to the
process structure (see proc.h) in order to save an exit status of the
terminated process.  We will need this for implementing wait.  Next,
you have to change all system calls affected by this change (e.g.,
exit, wait etc.).



<p>Part 3 (20 points): Change the exit system call signature to void exit(int
status). The exit system call must act as previously defined (i.e.,
terminate the current process) but it must also store the exit status
of the terminated process in the corresponding structure.  In order to
make the changes in exit system call you must update the following
files: user.h, defs.h, sysproc.c, proc.c and all the user space
programs that uses exit system call.  Note, from now on, all user
space programs must supply an exit status when terminated.

<p>
Hassle: one hassle that this change (and the one in part b below)
introduces is that all existing places that used exit(), including
ones that are in test programs have now to be changed to use the new
prototype.  You can either do that yourself (e.g., use grep to find
all locations of this call and change them), or create a new exit call
to match the new prototype.

<p>Goals of this part of the assignment: Get familiar with system call
arguments and how arguments are passed given the presence of two
stacks (user mode and kernel mode).  Understand the backward
compatibility hassles that come from modifying the system call
prototype.  Carry out a gentle modification to an existing system call
and to the Process Control Block (PCB), which will be needed by the
next part of the Lab.

<p>Part 4 (20 points): Update the wait system call signature to int wait(int
*status). The wait system call must prevent the current process from
execution until any of its child processes is terminated (if any
exists) and return the terminated child exit status through the status
argument.  The system call must return the process id of the child
that was terminated or -1 if no child exists (or unexpected error
occurred).  Note that the wait system call can receive NULL as an
argument. In this case the childâ€™s exit status must be discarded.

<p>Goal of this part of the assignment: Continue to get familiar with
system call arguments, in this case with how to return a value.

<p>Part 5 (15 points + 10 points bonus) Add a waitpid system call: int
waitpid(int pid, int *status, int options).  This system call must act
like wait system call with the following additional properties: The
system call must wait for a process (which must be one of your child
processes) with a pid that equals to one provided by the pid argument.
The return value must be the process id of the process that was
terminated or -1 if this process does not exist, if it is not a child
of the process that called the waitpid, or if an unexpected error
occurred.  We are required only to implement a blocking waitpid where
the kernel prevents the current process from execution until a process
with the given pid terminates.  In other words, you do not need to
worry about the options field for now.

<p>
Write an example program to illustrate that your waitpid works.  You
have to modify the makefile to add your example program so that it can
be executed from inside the shell once xv6 boots.


<h2>Help, hints, questions to explore, etc...</h2>

We will be extending this section based on how I see progress (for
example, to help you understand the code base, or provide ideas to
make you more effective in working with the code base).

<ul>
<li><b>Investing in learning gdb will really make your life easier this quarter!</b>  
There are only a few commands that you need to learn to get started.  
<ul>
<li><tt> break</tt> places a break point which causes the program to stop when it reaches that point.  There are many ways to set a break point; I like to use <tt>break function</tt>  to cause a stop at the function that I want to look at.

<li><tt> continue</tt> causes gdb to continue execution until the next break point.  If you want to execute only one line of the code use <tt>next</tt> or <tt>step</tt>.  The difference between the two is if the next line contains a function call, next will execute the full call before stopping while step steps into the function and stops at the first line there.

<li><tt> print</tt> allows you to examine a variable.  You can use some of the C semantics here, for example to derference a pointer and see the memory location its point to (e.g., print *p), to print a specific format such as string or hex (e.g., print %x p).  <tt> display</tt> is like print but it repeats the print every time gdb stops (e.g., after a break point or after a step or next)

<li><tt> list</tt> shows the code around the area you are.

<p>You can find more gdb help in the gdb resources linked on the class page under resources.
</ul>

<li>Another really useful tool is <tt>grep</tt>.  You can grep for a keyword (or if you are adventureous, a regular expression) in a file or group of files to find if/where it exists.  So, lets say I am interested in a specific function or variable and want to see where it is used.  In the xv6 directory, you can type: <tt>grep wait *.c</tt> to search for the string in all files ending with .c
<p>There are a couple of other useful options for grep.  The <tt> -i </tt> option (e.g., <tt> grep -i wait *.c</tt> will make grep ignore case.  The <tt> -v</tt> option excludes a pattern.  So, lets say you want to search for wait, but not waitpid.  One way you can do it is <tt>grep wait *.c | grep -v waitpid</tt>

<li>Background/deeper understanding: When any event in
xv6 occurs, the hardware switches mode to the operating system, and
jumps to the code in trapasm.S (starting at label alltraps).  This
code builds the trap frame (first segment), and then sets up the
memory segments for the kernel (second segment--unimportant for now).

<p>The trap frame is a data structure built on the stack that is used to
pass some important arguments to the trap handler including pointers
to the user stack to enable getting arguments to system calls.  Note
that the user stack and the kernel stack for a process are separate.
We discussed why in class.  So, when we push arguments for a system
call on the user stack, we need to give a pointer to the kernel to be
able to access them.

<p>You can see the trapframe structure in x86.h -- its ok to abstract
it away since we will not be working with it in detail.

<p>After filling parts of the trapframe, it calls trap() with the trap
frame as argument, which takes us to trap in trap.c

<p>Here you find a big switch statment based on the trapno that caused
the trap (this is stored in the trap frame).  Each case represents an
event and implements its trap handler.  Only a few events are
currently supported such as system calls and the timer interrupt which
are necessary for the barebones xv6 to run.

<p>If you look under the system call case (the first case), you see
some sanity checks (OS code is typically paranoid to avoid kernel
panics), you see that we eventually call syscall() which is the top
level handler for system calls.  Lets follow syscall which is located
at the bottom of syscall.c

<p>We get the system call number from the eax register in the user
code (saved on the trapframe) and use it to index into the system call
table and pick up the appropriate handler to call.  The return value
from the system call handler is stored in the register eax in the
trapframe (which is used by convention to store return values in
Linux/x86) to provide the return value back to the user.

<p>The handlers are all of the same function type (they are all called
sys_xyz where xyz is the system call they handle) which enables us to
use this trap handler table and call any one of them as appropriate.

<p>Lets look at the implementation of one of these, lets say sys_kill()
which passes a signal to a process, often to kill it.  

<p>sys_kill() and several other handlers are implemented in sysproc.c
because they have to do with processes.  Other handlers are
implemented in the file system code, or memory code as appropriate to
their operation.  Use grep to find them if you can't figure out where
they are.

<p> You will note that sys_kill eventually calls kill where the real
implementation of the system call is.  This enables us to pass
different parameters to each system call to get around the fact that the sys_ handler are all the same type.

<p>Note also that sys_kill had to get those parameters from the user
stack.  To help with this low level read, there are a number of
accessor functions (argint, argstr, etc...) defined to get access to
the arguments based by the user by using information in the trapframe.
