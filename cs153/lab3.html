<h2>Objectives</h2> 

<li>Implement Shared Memory 


<h2>Preliminaries</h2>

For this assignment we will use some starter code which is needed for Lab 3 (the same base used for Lab 3). You can get the starter code from the <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/xtWkyi3P">lab3 github classroom link</a>. 
 
<!-- <h2>Part 1: Memory translation system call</h2> -->

<!-- <h3>Overview</h3> -->

<!-- The goal of this part is to learn about how the OS manages memory. -->

<!-- <h3>Details</h3> -->

<!-- Add a system call  -->

<!-- <code>int v2p(int virtual, int *physical)</code> -->

<!-- v2p takes a virtual address and returns a physical address.  v2p -->
<!-- should return an error if the virtual address is not valid (e.g., out -->
<!-- of range) or not mapped. -->

<h2>Implement shared memory</h2>

<p>In this assignment you are implementing support to enable two
processes to share a memory page.  This is implemented by having an
entry in both process page tables point to the same physical page.

<p>Start by looking at the user program shm_cnt.c in the repo.  In
this program we fork a process, then both processes open a shared
memory segment with the same id using:

<p><tt>shm_open(1,(char **)(&counter));</tt>

<p>For this system call, the first parameter gives an id for the shared
memory segment, and the pointer is used to return a pointer to the
shared page.  By having this pointer be of type <tt>shm_cnt</tt>, we
can access this struct off of this pointer and we would be accessing
the shared memory page.

<p>The code then proceeds to have both processes go through a loop
repeatedly incrementing the counter in the shared page (acquiring a
user level spin lock to make sure we dont lose updates; test your
program without the lock and see if it makes a difference).  The
uspinlock is implemented in the starter code in uspinlock.c and
uspinlock.h -- take a look.

<p>At the end, each process prints the value of the counter, closes the
shared memory segment and exits using <tt>shm_close(1)</tt>.  One of
them should have a value of 20000 reflecting updates from both the
processes.  Check your code without the spinlock to see if you lose updates.


<p>Your task is to implement shm_open and shm_close.  They are already
added as system calls; you should write your code in shm.c

<p>shm_open looks through the shm_table to see if this segment id already
exists.  If it doesn't then it needs to allocate a page and map it,
and store this information in the shm_table.  Dont forget to grab the
lock while you are working with the shm_table (why?).  If the segment
already exists, increase the refence count, and use mappages to add
the mapping between the virtual address and the physical address.  In
either case, return the virtual address through the second parameter
of the system call.

<p>shm_close is simpler: it looks for the shared memory segment in
shm_table.  If it finds it it decrements the reference count.  If it
reaches zero, then it clears the shm_table.  You do not need to free
up the page since it is still mapped in the page table.  Ok to leave
it that way.

<h2>Bonus: mmap</h2>

<p>Implement two system calls 
<p><tt>void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length)</tt> and
<p><tt>int munmap(void *addr, size_t length)</tt>
<p> mmap is an alternative to malloc where you also tell the operating
system where to place the allocated page(s) in virtual memory space.
To implement this correctly, you should first confirm that the virtual
address/pages are available (otherwise error) and then allocate the
physical page and add the mapping to the page directory.  Specifically:
<p>
On success, <tt>mmap()</tt> returns a pointer to the mapped area.  On
       error, the value <tt>MAP_FAILED</tt> (that is, <tt>(void *) -1</tt>) is returned,
       and errno is set to indicate the error.

<p> unmap does the opposite and frees the memory and remove the mapping from the page table.

<p>If you are really adventureous, you can implement the file memory mapping part of mmap (see for example <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap man page</a>).  Talk to me if you decide to do this.
<h2>Hints</h2> 

<p><b> IMPORTANT </b>: Check out the <a href="lab3-survival.txt">Lab 3 survival guide</a> for more detailed help.


<!-- <h2>Alternative more challenging project (not for the faint of heart)</h2>

<p>This project is intended as an alternative to the shared memory
project, only if you want a harder challenge.  We will not suppor this
project, primarily because we have not implemented it ourselves.

<p>Implement copy-on-write.  If you are interested in implementing CoW,
please talk to me for more instructions although I have not
implemented it myself so I may not be able to provide something
similar to the survival guide.  I am willing to give a 20\% bonus if
you implement this successfully.

<p>The tasks primarily will include modifying fork to avoid duplicating
the memory pages but rather just map the same pages of the original
process to both.  You have to figure out where the return value to
fork is placed (typically in register eax, but check), and if in
memory treat that page differently.  You also have to change the page
table entries for all the user level pages to be read only on both the
parent and the child.

<p>The second part of the implementation is to add handler in trap.c when
there is a page fault and the cause is a write to a read only page.
In that case, you have to check if the mapping is the same between the
parent and the child, create a duplicate page, and update the page
table for the writing process to point to the new page.  Both page
table entries should be set to read/write.

<p>The problem gets super complicated if there are multiple forks.  Dont
worry about that -- get it working with two processes. -->
